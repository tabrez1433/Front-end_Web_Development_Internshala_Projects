I have used these:

* <link> tag to attach other/external file with the HTML document file.

* alt attribute defines an alternative text description of the image.
* <a> anchor tag to create routes or hyperlink between current page to another pages.
* href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to, without href <a> tag will not be hyperlink.
* Heading tags (<h1> - <h6>) for define HTML headings. Headings are the titles or the subtitles of the content that we want to display on the web page.
* <ul> tag defines an unordered (bulleted) list
* <li> tag used to define a list item in ordered & unordered lists
* <p> tag is used to define paragraph of the webpage
* The :hover selector CSS pseudo-class is used to style elements when the mouse hovers over them. It can be used on every element.
