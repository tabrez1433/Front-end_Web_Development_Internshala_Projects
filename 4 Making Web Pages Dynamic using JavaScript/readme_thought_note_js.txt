On code, I have commented regarding the tags and attribute uses for better go through.

I have used these:

* <title> tag to label the title of web pages.
* <link> tag to attach other/external file with the HTML document file.
* <div> tag to define a division or a section in an HTML document.
* <label> tag is used to specify a label for an <input> element of a form.
* <input> tag specifies an input field where the user can enter data.
* <select> element is used to create a drop-down list.
* <option> tag defines an option in a select list. 
* Heading tags (<h1> - <h6>) for define HTML headings. Headings are the titles or the subtitles of the content that we want to display on the web page.
* <button> tags is used to create an HTML button
* The :hover selector CSS pseudo-class is used to style elements when the mouse hovers over them. It can be used on every element.
* The !important rule in CSS is used to add more importance to a property/value than normal. It is used to override all previous styling rules for that specific property on that element
