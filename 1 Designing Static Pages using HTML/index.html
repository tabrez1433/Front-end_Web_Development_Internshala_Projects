    <h4><u>About Dhanbad :</u></h4>
    <!-- paragraph tag start here -->
    <p>
        Dhanbad district was constituted in 1956 by carving out the old Dhanbad subdivision, Chas and Chandankiyari
        police stations of the Sadar subdivision of the erstwhile Manbhum district. Dhanbad is Police district since
        1928. The re-organisation of the districts in the State of Bihar which took place after 1971 did not affect the
        district of Dhanbad. In 1991 a part of Dhanbad district was sliced away to form Bokaro district.

        Dhanbad is the second-most populated city in the Indian state of Jharkhand after Jamshedpur. It ranks as the 42nd largest city in India and is the 33rd largest million-plus urban agglomeration in India. Dhanbad shares its land borders with Paschim Bardhaman district and Purulia district of West Bengal and Bokaro, Giridih and Jamtara districts of Jharkhand. The city is called the 'Coal Capital of India' for housing one of the largest coal mines in the country. The prestigious institute, Indian School of Mines (now IIT Dhanbad) is situated in Dhanbad. Apart from coal, it has also grown in information technology.
